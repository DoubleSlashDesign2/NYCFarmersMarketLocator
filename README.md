NYCFarmersMarketLocator
=======================

Find farmers markets near you!

This is an alpha-level app, so far. To find a farmers market within 1 mile of a given location, type an address in the search bar or allow the browser to auto-detect your location when you click on the "Nearby" button.

Features I plan to add:
- Distance from current location: XX mi
- Products available
- Better website links
- Detect whether a market is open or closed at time of search
- Prioritize order of markets based on distance and open/closed
- local storage or cache

This project was originally concieved as an app to find an open farmers market near a user's location. I finally got a chance to start working on it while taking Thinkful's Front-end Web Development class in the fall of 2013.
